    "## 1.1 Scenario and Background\n",
    "I am a data scientist and a new mom currently residing in Iran. My husband and I plan to migrate to Toronto with our 6-month-old daughter, in less than three months. Migration seems to be difficult. However, things are much more complicated when you have a baby. Our number one concern is definitely finding the most suitable neighborhood which is appropriate for our new lifestyle with child (a neighborhood having lots of amenities nearby like health centres, parks and recreational centres, baby care centres, shopping centres, public transportation facilities…), while at the same time it is reasonably priced. We are really keen on finding the appropriate neighborhood and then apply for jobs based on that, as the place to live is our top-rank concern when having baby. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during this Coursera certification to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it is more worthwhile doing it by myself with learned tools.\n",

    "## 1.2 Problem to be resolved:\n",
    "The challenge to resolve is being able to find a short time rental apartment unit in Toronto that offers the characteristics and benefits I mentioned earlier. Therefore, in order to set a basis for this problem, I want to find a rental unit subject to the following conditions:\n",
    "1.\tAn entire home/apartment with monthly rent not to exceed $150/night\n",
    "2.\tMedium Availability (100days/year)\n",
    "3.\tUnit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Toronto\n",
    "4.\tArea with ammenities and venues mentioned earlier (at least one venue of each category ) within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Interested Audience:\n",
    "I believe this is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to a major city like Toronto, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills.\n",
    "# 2. Data Section:\n",
    "Description of the data and its sources that will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "## 2.1 Data of Toronto Boroughs and Neighborhoods:\n",
    "As previously done in the lab, we can derive the Toronto boroughs and neighborhoods from the data of postal codes. Also, the subway list and Airbnb data on rentals are needed for this analysis.\n",
    "## 2.2 Data Required to resolve the problem:\n",
    "In order to make a good choice of an apartment in Toronto, the following data is required:\n",
    "•\tList/Information on neighborhoods form Toronto with their Geodata ( latitud and longitud.)\n",
    "•\tList/Information about the subway metro stations in Toronto with geodata. \n",
    "•\tListed apartments for rent in Toronto area with descriptions (price, location, address) \n",
    "•\tVenues and ammenities in the Toronto neighborhoods (e.g. top 10) 2.3 sources and manipulation \n",
    "## 2.3. Data Derivation:\n",
    "•\tThe list of Toronto neighborhoods is worked out during LAb exercise during the course. A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. \n",
    "df_toronto():\n",
    "          \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA list of Toronto subway metro stops was complied in Numbers (Apple excel) and it was complemeted with wikipedia data ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toronto_subway_stations).\n",
    "•\tfor a final consolidated list of subway stops names and their address. The geolocation was obtained via an algorithm using Nominatim. Details will be shown in the execution of methodolody in section 3.0. The subway csv file is Toronto_subway.csv'\" \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA list of places for short term rent was collected from Airbnb.com in Toronto http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html .\n",
    "A csv file was compiled with the rental place that indicated: areas of Toronto, address, home type, availability and monthly/night rental price. The csv file \"Airbnb_rental_data.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorithm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim() , it was possible to determine the latitude and longiude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorithms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius. Foursquare is used to find the avenues at Toronto neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending of the location shown.\n",
    "## 2.4 How the data will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "The data will be used as follows: Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Toronto neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB) Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations. create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area. Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim. Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n",
    "## 2.5 Mapping of Data\n",
    "The following maps were created to facilitate the analysis and the choice of the palace to live. \n",
    "•\tToronto map of Neighborhoods \n",
    "•\tToronto subway metro locations \n",
    "•\tToronto map of places for rent \n",
    "•\tToronto map of clustered venues and neighborhoods \n",
    "•\tCombined maps of Toronto rent places with subway locations \n",
    "•\tCombined maps of Toronto rent places with subway locations and venues clusters\n"
